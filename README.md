# Random stuff generator

Just as name suggests, this WinFormsApp can generate some things. For example: 
PIN codes (code for that is cursed and probably not the best);
desired length password generator which creates a scrambled string of various complexity - from random letters to combination of random letters, numbers and symbols;
"flip a coin" function

Perhaps an insecure password manager add-on will be made in the future
